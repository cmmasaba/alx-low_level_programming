# C - Recursion
A project I did while learning full stack software engineering at ALX School. Concepts covered in this project are `recursion` in C programming language

## Technologies
Technoloies I used for this project are:
- Environment: `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
- Standard: `C90`
- Compiler: `gcc` 4.8.4

## Files
The following files are contained in this project and a brief description
|**File name**| **Brief Description**|
|:-------------|----------------------|
|0-puts_recursion.c| a function that prints a string|
|1-print_rev_recursion.c| a function that prints a string in reverse|
|2-strlen_recursion.c| a function that returns the length of a string|
|3-factorial.c| a function that returns the factorial of a given number|
|4-pow_recursion.c| a function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`|
|5-sqrt_recursion.c| a function that returns the natural square root of a number|
|6-is_prime_number.c| a function that checks if a digit is a prime number|
|100-is_palindrome.c| a function that checks if a string is a palindrome|
|101-wildcmp.c| a function that checks if two strings can be considered identical|

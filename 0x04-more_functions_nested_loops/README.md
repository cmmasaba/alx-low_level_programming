# C - More functions, more nested loops
A project I did while learning full stack software engineering at ALX School. Concepts covered in this project are `functions` `nested loops` `function prototypes` `header files`

## Technologies
Technoloies I used for this project are:
- Environment: `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
- Standard: `C90`
- Compiler: `gcc` 4.8.4

## Files
The following files are contained in this project and a brief description
|**File name**| **Brief Description**|
|:-------------|----------------------|
|0-isupper.c| a function that checks for uppercase character|
|1-isdigit.c| a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9)|
|2-mul.c| a function that multiplies two integers|
|3-print_numbers.c| a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9|
|4-print_most_numbers.c| a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9|
|5-more_numbers.c| a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14|
|6-print_line.c| a function that draws a straight line in the terminal|
|7-print_diagonal.c| a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal|
|8-print_square.c| a function that prints a square, followed by a new line|
|9-fizz_buzz.c| a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz|
|10-print_triangle.c| a function that prints a triangle|
|100-prime_factor.c| a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143|
|101-print_number.c| a function that prints an integer|

# C - Variables, if, else, while
A project I did while learning full stack software engineering at ALX School. Concepts covered in this project are `variables` `loops` `operators` `if statements`

## Technologies
Technoloies I used for this project are:
- Environment: `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
- Standard: `C90`
- Compiler: `gcc` 4.8.4

## Files
The following files are contained in this project and a brief description
|**File name**| **Brief Description**|
|:-------------|----------------------|
|0-positive_or_negative.c| a program that assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed|
|1-last_digit.c| a program that assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed|
|2-print_alphabet.c| a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase|
|3-print_alphabets.c| a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase|
|4-print_alphabt.c| a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase|
|5-print_numbers.c| a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0|
|6-print_numberz.c| a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0|
|7-print_tebahpla.c| a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse|
|8-print_base16.c| a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase|
|9-print_comb.c| a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers|

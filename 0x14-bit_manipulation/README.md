# C - Bit manipulation 
A project I did while learning full stack software engineering at ALX School. Concepts covered in this project are how to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators.

## Technologies
Technoloies I used for this project are:
- Environment: `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
- Standard: `C90`
- Compiler: `gcc 9.4.0`

## Files
The following files are contained in this project and a brief description
|**File name**| **Brief Description**|
|:-------------|----------------------|
|0-binary_to_uint.c| converts binary to unsigned int|
|1-print_binary.c| prints binary representation of a number|
|2-get_bit.c| finds value of a bi at given index|
|3-set_bit.c| sets bit at given index to 1|
|4-clear_bit.c| sets bit at given index to 0|
|5-flip_bits.c| finds number of bit you need to flip to get from one number to another|
|100-get_endianness.c| checks the endianness|

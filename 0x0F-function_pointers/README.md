# C - Function pointers 
A project I did while learning full stack software engineering at ALX School. Concepts covered in this project are what are function pointers, what it holds, where it points to in the virtual memory and how to use them.

## Technologies
Technoloies I used for this project are:
- Environment: `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
- Standard: `C90`
- Compiler: `gcc 9.4.0`

## Files
The following files are contained in this project and a brief description
|**File name**| **Brief Description**|
|:-------------|----------------------|
|function_pointers.h| header file containing function declarations|
|0-print_name.c| a function that prints a name|
|1-array_iterator.c| a function that executes given function as a parameter on each element of the array|
|2-int_index.c| a function that searches for an integer|
|3-calc.h| header file for a program that performs simple operations|
|3-main.c| driver function for a program that performs simple operations|
|3-op_functions.c| helper function for the program that performs operations|
|3-get_op_func.c| helper function for the program that performs operations|
|100-main_opcodes.c| a program that prints opcodes for its own main function|

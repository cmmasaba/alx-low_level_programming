# C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
A project I did while learning full stack software engineering at ALX School. Concepts covered in this project are `pointers`, `arrays` and `strings`

## Technologies
Technoloies I used for this project are:
- Environment: `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
- Standard: `C90`
- Compiler: `gcc 9.4.0`

## Files
The following files are contained in this project and a brief description
|**File name**| **Brief Description**|
|:-------------|----------------------|
|0-memset.c| a function that fills memory with a constant byte|
|1-memcpy.c| a function that copies memory area|
|2-strchr.c| a function that locates a character in a string|
|3-strspn.c| a function that gets the length of a prefix substring|
|4-strpbrk.c| a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes|
|5-strstr.c| a function that locates a substring|
|7-print_chessboard.c| a function that prints the chessboard|
|8-print_diagsums.c| a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers|
|100-set_string.c| a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char|
|101-crackme_password| create a file that contains the password for the [crackme2](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x06.c) executable|
